* Personal Website
This is the home of my personal website, [[https://kwpav.github.io][kwpav.github.io]]. It is (currently) built using Hugo and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]].

After exporting posts here using =ox-hugo=, I run the server to test:
#+begin_src sh
  hugo server -D
#+end_src

Then deploy it to [[https://kwpav.github.io][kwpav.github.io]] using:
#+begin_src sh
  ./deploy.sh
#+end_src

This builds the site to the =public/= folder, commits the change, and pushes it to =kwpav/kwpav.github.io=.
